# Acrobot - The Magic 90's Word Game Reviver
Acrobot is an open source recreation of the Registration Server and IRC bot used in the 1997-2001 Berkeley Systems version of [Acrophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophobia_(game)).
Please note that this is HEAVILY in WIP territory. Use at your own risk.

## Progress

## How to setup
