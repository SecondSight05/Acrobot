# Acrobot
A plugin for [Sopel](https://sopel.chat/) that recreates the Acrobot for the Berkeley Systems version of Acrophobia.

If you're just looking to play the game, check out [Bezerk Revived](https://bezerk.secondzone.co.uk) (The server this bot was originally made for).

(NOTE: The game isn't avaliable on Bezerk Revived yet, this is just a temporary thing.)

(More details coming once I make the first upload...)
